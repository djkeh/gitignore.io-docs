# Client Application

### [Go](https://github.com/Gnouc/gogi) — [Cuong Manh Le](https://github.com/Gnouc)

```text
go get -u github.com/Gnouc/gogi
```

### [Python](https://github.com/Antrikshy/ignr.py) — [Antriksh Yadav](https://github.com/Antrikshy)

```text
pip install ignr
```

### [Node](https://github.com/TejasQ/add-gitignore) — [Tejas Kumar](https://github.com/TejasQ)

You'll want to make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. Then, setup is as simple as:

```text
npx add-gitignore
```

If you've got an older version of node that doesn't yet have [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), here's a more traditional setup:

```text
npm i -g add-gitignore
add-gitignore macOS Emacs node # or whatever you need
```

Alternatively, running just `add-gitignore` gives you a nice multi-select interface from which you can choose what to ignore, and using the `--help` flag helps you out.
